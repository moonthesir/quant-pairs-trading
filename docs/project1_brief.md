Implemented a reproducible Python backtesting pipeline for a mean-reversion pairs strategy (AAPLâ€“MSFT), including parameter optimization, transaction cost modeling, and walk-forward validation.

I built a Python backtesting pipeline that implements a dollar-neutral mean-reversion pairs trading strategy. For candidate pairs I compute OLS beta, construct the spread, generate z-score signals using a rolling lookback, and simulate entries/exits with realistic transaction costs and slippage. I perform parameter search and walk-forward validation, report risk-adjusted metrics (CAGR, annual volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown), and produce robustness checks across parameter grids, alternate pairs, and transaction cost regimes. Code and results are reproducible in a public repository.
